(a)
For h1, see Q5_a_h1.jpg
For h2, see Q5_a_h2.jpg

Optimal solution (8 moves):
  1. Move 6 right
  2. Move 8 right
  3. Move 7 down
  4. Move 4 down
  5. Move 1 left
  6. Move 2 up
  7. Move 5 left
  8. Move 6 up

(b)
h1:
  admissible:
    Each misplaced tile needs at least 1 move to the correct place.
    So actual cost h*(n) >= h1.
  consistent:
    Every step's cost is 1. 
    At most one tile becomes correct or incorrect after moving.
    So, h1(n) - h1(n') <= 1 -> h1(n) <= 1 + h1(n'), n is the old state and n' is new state, 1 is cost.

h2:
  admissible:
    Each misplaced tile needs at least Manhattan distance to reach its correct place.
    So actual cost h*(n) >= h2.
  consistent:
    Every step's cost is 1. 
    Each move changes one tile's Manhattan distance by at most 1.
    So, h2(n) - h2(n') <= 1 -> h2(n) <= 1 + h2(n'), n is the old state and n' is new state, 1 is cost.

Comparison:
  h2 >= h1 for all states (Manhattan distance >= 1 for each misplaced tile).
  A larger heuristic provides more information and expands fewer nodes.
  So h2 is better than h1.

Part 1: the initial state 41372586 is solvable

Initial score is 8. 
When a tile moves horizontally, the score is unchanged. Because moving can't change the series order.
When a tile moves vertically move, the score will +2, -2, +0. Because moving skips two tiles:
  Assume we move tile X, skipping tile A and tile B.
  When X < A and X < B, score adds 2.
  When X > A and X > B, score decreases by 2.
  When A < X < B or B < X < A, score stays unchanged.
Our goal is score = 0, so in this situation, we can achieve the goal.

Part 2: the initial state 41372568 is not solvable

According to the part 1 solution, the score of this state is 7.
It's an odd number and we can't change it to 0.
So, it's not solvable.

Part 3: Of these 40320 initial states, determine how many are solvable

For any permutation, swapping two numbers will cause the score +1 or -1.
Every odd series can change to even series through one swap, and vice versa.
Thus, one odd series vs. one even series.
Answer = 40320 / 2 = 20160, because half of them have even score.
